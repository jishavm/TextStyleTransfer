We have implemented style transfer in text as described in "Style Transfer from Non-Parallel Text by Cross-Alignment". Tianxiao Shen, Tao Lei, Regina Barzilay, and Tommi Jaakkola. NIPS 2017. [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09655)" to perform conversion between Modern English and Shakespearean English.
We have reused Tianxiao Shen's code ( Please see here: https://github.com/shentianxiao/language-style-transfer/tree/f078a9d342705ea62b04dd3ac5926d3467c2ac63 )

We used the Shakespearean data from : https://github.com/tlatkowski/st
